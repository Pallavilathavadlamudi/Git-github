# INTRODUCTION TO GIT

1. What is Git?
   
    Git is the most popular Version Control System (VCS). It is a software tool that tracks and manages changes to files over time.

    Git was created on April 3, 2005, by Linus Torvalds, and it started as a command-line tool. One of the nicknames for Git is "Global Information Tracker".

2. Why is Git useful?
    
    It helps developers work together on the same project.
    You can track changes, undo mistakes, and work in parallel with others.
    It makes managing large codebases and team projects much easier.

3. What does a Version Control System (VCS) do?
   
    A Version Control System like Git helps users manage changes to files over time. It allows you to

        1. Revisit earlier versions of files
        2. Compare changes between different versions
        3. Undo changes if needed
        4. Share changes with others easily

4. Different Types of Version Control Systems:

    There are many Version Control Systems (VCS), and they differ in how they work. Some common examples include:

        1. Git – the most popular, distributed VCS
        2. Subversion (SVN) – a centralized VCS
        3. CVS (Concurrent Versions System) – an older centralized VCS

    Each system has its own way of tracking and managing changes. Git is widely used today because it's fast, works offline, and supports collaboration better than older systems.

5. Why Git?
    
    Git is the most popular Version Control System in the world.

    In Stack Overflow’s 2018 Developer Survey, nearly 90% of developers said they use Git as their version control  system of choice.

6. Other Version Control Systems
    
    Subversion (SVN) – A centralized version control system. All changes are tracked through a central server.
    
    CVS (Concurrent Versions System) – An older centralized VCS. It has limited features, like poor local branching and slower performance compared to modern tools like Git.
    
    Both SVN and CVS are part of the broader category called SCM (Source Control Management) systems — tools that help manage source code and track changes.

7. What Exactly Does Git Do?
    
    Git helps you manage and track your project over time. Here’s what it can do:

    ✅ Track changes across multiple files.
    ✅ Compare different versions of your project.
    ✅ Time travel to old versions (see past states of your code).
    ✅ Revert to a previous version if something breaks.
    ✅ Collaborate with others and share changes.
    ✅ Combine changes from different team members (merge).


8. Consider a example: 

    🏗️ Example: Building a Project/Website with Git

    Imagine you're building a website. Git helps you manage your progress step-by-step — like saving your progress at each level. Here's what each part of your diagram represents:

    🔘 Checkpoints (Commits)

    > Every time you finish a part of the site (e.g., homepage, navigation, contact form), you make a Git commit.
    > Each circle in the diagram is one of these commits.
    > It’s like saying: “Save my project right here.”
    Example: You create a basic homepage and make a commit: git commit -m "Added homepage layout".

    🔙 Going Back to Older Checkpoints
    
    > If you add a feature that breaks the site, you can go back to a working commit (checkpoint).
    > Git allows you to “rewind” to that earlier version.
    Example: The new CSS update broke your layout → Go back to the last working commit.

    🌿 Creating Branches (Hopping Around Versions)
    
    > You can make a branch to try something new without affecting the main project.
    > In the diagram, these are paths splitting off.
    Example: You want to add a dark mode → create a dark-mode branch and test it without breaking the main website.

    🔀 Combining Two Checkpoints (Merging)
    
    > Once your new feature (like dark mode) works well, you can merge it back into the main branch.
    > The diagram shows branches coming together — that’s a merge.
    > Git compares both checkpoint paths and combines them.

    🔍 Comparing Versions
    
    > Git lets you compare any two checkpoints to see what changed.
    > The "compare" labels in your diagram show that.
    Example: Compare v1-homepage with v2-homepage to see what HTML or CSS changed.  

    📦 Project History as a Network
    
    > Your diagram shows that Git is not just a straight line.
    > It's like a web of changes — you can branch, merge, experiment, and explore.
    > It’s flexible and safe — you don’t lose work as long as you commit regularly.
